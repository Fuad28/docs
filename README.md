# 💜 Welcome to The Love API
### Official Documentation for the Love API — V1.0 (Forever Stable Release)


Welcome to **The Love API** — a halal, secure, and highly available life-long integration between **Maryam** and **Fuad**, deployed by Allah’s permission.

This is not spaghetti love.  
This is *hot-rice-and-dodo-on-a-rainy-night* kind of love. 🍚

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

The Love API is a **real-life system** that:
- Turns duʿā into destiny
- Converts friendship into marriage
- Runs on patience, prayer, and plenty laughter

Is it technical?
> Small.

Is it emotional?
> Very.

Is it for playing?
> **God forbid.**
