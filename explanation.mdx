You know that saying about **spaghetti being sweeter than love**? 

Hmmmm. I believed it too o, I won’t lie.  

But omoooo 😭 Spaghetti really *fell my hand*.

It has officially been dethroned and gently moved to the lower end of my priority list. That's why today is not about spaghetti. Today is about the **Love API** 💜

## 💕 What Is the Love API?

The **Love API** is a **real-life connection** between **Maryam and Fuad**, designed with intention, prayer, patience, and plenty laughter.

> Is it an app?  
> No.


> Is it vibes?  
>   Yes.


> Is it for playing?   
> *God forbid.*

<Tip>
This one no be “we’re talking” or “let’s see how it goes” This one is “we are doing.”
</Tip>

## 📖 Why Does This API Exist?

Because love needs:
- Care
- Communication
- Commitment
- And small-small sense 😌

This API exists to:
- Grow friendship into marriage
- Turn dua into destiny
- And build a home where peace lives rent-free

## 👩🏽‍❤️‍👨🏽 The Authors

### 🧕🏼 Maryam
- Brings warmth, kindness, and soft strength
- Makes sure love is gentle and expressive
- Ensures everyone feels heard (even when emotions are loud)

### 👨🏽‍💻 Fuad
- Brings structure, calm, and logic
- Keeps things steady when life tries to shake the system
- Ensures the future is well planned

But as you know, Allah is the real architect behind the scenes.

## 🕌 What Powers the Love API?

- **Allah** — the Main Source (no need for backup). Because true true, we're nothing but pencils in the hand of the Creator.
- **Du’a** — Prayers. As per: *"We're alive, no be because we dey drink 5Alive. Na because Allah makes us survive.”*
- **Sabr** — patience when life buffers
- **Communication** — talking it out, no ghosting
- **Laughter** — because laughter is the best medicine.
