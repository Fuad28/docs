You know that saying that **spaghetti is sweeter than love**?

Hmmm… I believed it o.  
But omoooo 😭, spaghetti fall my hand **big time**.

Spaghetti has been **dethroned**, respectfully. It has now moved to the lower end of my priority list. That's why today is not about spaghetti. Today is about the **Love API** 💜

## 💕 What Is the Love API?


<Note>
“API” is pronounced **A–P–I**, not *“happy”*.  
In the real world, an API is a tool developers use to make systems talk to each other.  
But calm down, today is not tech class. We’re here for gist 😌
</Note>

The **Love API** is a **real-life connection** between **Maryam and Fuad**, designed with intention, prayer, patience, and **plenty laughter**.


> Is it an app?  
> No.


> Is it vibes?  
>   Yes.


> Is it for playing?   
> *God forbid.*

<Tip>
This one no be “we’re talking” or “let’s see how it goes” This one is “we are doing.”
</Tip>

## 📖 Why Does This API Exist?

Because love needs:
- Care
- Communication
- Commitment
- And small-small sense 😌 (plenty sense actually 😂) 

This API exists to:
- Grow friendship into marriage
- Turn dua into destiny
- And build a home where peace lives rent-free

<Note>
This is the kind of love that feels like **hot puff-puff on a chilly evening** i.e Warm, filling, intentional.

## 👩🏽‍❤️‍👨🏽 The Authors

### 🧕🏼 Maryam
- Brings warmth, kindness, and soft strength
- Makes sure love is gentle and expressive
- Ensures everyone feels heard (even when emotions are loud)

### 👨🏽‍💻 Fuad
- Brings structure, calm, and logic

But as you know, Allah is the real architect behind the scenes.

## 🕌 What Powers The Love API?

- **Allah** — the Main Source (no need for backup). Because true true, we're nothing but pencils in the hand of the Creator.
- **Du’a** — Prayers. As per: *"We're alive, no be because we dey drink 5Alive. Na because Allah makes us survive.”*
- **Sabr** — patience when life buffers
- **Communication** — talking it out, no ghosting
- **Laughter** — because laughter is the best medicine.
